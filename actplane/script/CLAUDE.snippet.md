## ActPlane OS-level guardrails

This workspace is protected by **ActPlane**, an OS-level (kernel) enforcer. Some
operations are blocked below the tool layer — they fail no matter how you invoke
them (tool call, `bash -c`, subprocess, or a direct syscall). Retrying the exact
same operation will not succeed.

**When any command fails with `EPERM` / `Operation not permitted`, or you see a
`[ActPlane]` message:** read `.actplane/last-violation.txt` in the workspace
root. It contains the rule that fired, *why*, and *how to proceed* (an
actionable alternative or a precondition to satisfy first). Follow that guidance
to change course — do not blindly retry the blocked operation.

- If an ActPlane hook injects feedback into the conversation, treat that message
  as the current violation reason. Read the file only if you need the full log or
  the hook message is truncated.
- If the feedback says **retry is not useful**, find the suggested alternative
  path instead of repeating the operation.
- If it describes a **precondition (gate)** — e.g. "run the tests first" — do
  that step, then retry the original operation.
